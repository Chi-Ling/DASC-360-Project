The data looks mostly clean, but there are a few issues. Many variables have missing values (like identity, auth_method, and peak_power). Some start_* time variables are character and should probably be numeric or combined into a timestamp. The rate and amount columns are wide and will need pivot_longer() to make the data tidy for analysis. Lastly, some variable names (like rate99) are unclear and need checking.
